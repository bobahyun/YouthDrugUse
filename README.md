## Factors That Influence Youth Drug Use

This project investigates factors associated with drug and alcohol use in youth groups, using a subset of the 2020 National Survey on Drug Consumption and Health dataset. The study uses decision trees, boosting, bagging, and random forest to predict cigarette, marijuana, and alcohol use in youth. The results indicate that factors such as the youth's grade level, number of school absences, race, health, and metropolitan area size were significant predictors of cigarette use. Marijuana use was predicted by the youth's perception of their close friends, parents, and peers' attitudes towards drug use, as well as their race and health. Grade level and school absences were significant predictors of alcohol use. The study emphasizes the importance of considering demographic and environmental factors when studying drug and alcohol use in youth.
